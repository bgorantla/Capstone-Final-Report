Results
What did your research find?

Answer to question 1:
The life expectancy in both developed and developing countries has steadily although the number of developed countries has very slightly increased over the years.
The difference in longevity between the two types of countries is still 8 years in the year 2015.

Answer to quetion 2:
Funnily enough, the most important factor that affects longevity in developed countries is 'thinness 1-19 years'. The second most important feature is 'thinness 5-9 years'. An abundance of resources in developed countries is affecting the longevity of the population.
For developing countries on the other hand, income and HIV/AIDS are the two biggest features that affect longevity while thinness are fourth and fifth place.
HIV/AIDS come in last place in developed countries. This is likely due to better access to medicine.
